# Chromatic-Scale-Shuffler
The Chromatic Scale Shuffler keeps guitar warm ups interesting. Instead of playing 1-2-3-4 patterns every day, this tool gives you a shuffled order, random fret to start and stroke direction. This way you get a new challenge everytime and enhance your practice routine.

## chromatic_scale_shuffler.exe
This is the stand alone executable program. If you just want to use the tool, you only need this.

### That's how the program looks:
