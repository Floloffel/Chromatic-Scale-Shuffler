# Guitar exercises
This repository contains guitar exercises to keep warm ups interesting. They are available as python scripts and exe files.

# Chromatic-Scale-Shuffler
Instead of playing 1-2-3-4 patterns every day, this tool gives you a shuffled order, random fret to start and stroke direction. This way you get a new challenge everytime and enhance your practice routine.

# Fretboard-Note-Trainer
This tool gives you 20 random string and fret combinations where you have to name the corresponding note. It's set up as a 6 string guitar in standard tuning.
